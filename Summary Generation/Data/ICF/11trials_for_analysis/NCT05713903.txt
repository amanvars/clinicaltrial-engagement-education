randomized controlled trial
The purpose of this research protocol is to compare laparoscopic versus open right 
colectomy according to the complete mesocolic excision principles (CME) in patients with 
right colon cancer. The study protocol is designed as a prospective randomized controlled 
study. The comparison of the two groups will be based on early and late postoperative 
endpoints. In addition, the efficacy of both approaches in terms of the specimen quality 
characteristics and the oncological outcomes will be evaluated.

The patient will be admitted to the surgical department according to the predetermined 
procedure. All the necessary preoperative and laboratory examinations will be performed. 
A multidisciplinary oncology board will follow to determine the optimal treatment. The 
patient, then, will be randomized to one of the two groups. Following this, the patient will 
be  submitted  to  the  optimal  operation  for  him  /  her  to  treat  his  /  her  condition. 
Postoperatively the patient will be monitored in the surgical department according to the 
existing protocols and guidelines.
