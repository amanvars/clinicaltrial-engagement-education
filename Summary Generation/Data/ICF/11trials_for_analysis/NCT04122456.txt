Key Information Summary
The purpose of this consent form is to give you information about this research study. It is up to you 
to decide whether to take part in this study.  If you choose not to participate your decision will not 
affect your current or future relationship with Wright State Physicians.  If you decide to participate, 
you are free to withdraw at any time without affecting that relationship.
The purpose of this study is to test how the skin of night shift workers responds to artificial sunlight 
(ultraviolet B radiation; UVB) at two different times of the day in comparison to normal day shift 
workers. After the skin biopsies are obtained, they will be brought to the laboratory to be exposed to 
UVB radiation and to measure UVB responses. 
If you agree to be in this study the following will happen:

Informed Consent: You will be asked to sign an Informed Consent form

You will be asked to fill in a monthly calendar outlining your approximate work schedule for the 
past three (3) months

8 am: Two small round holes (5 mm, or 1/5 inch, which is the size of a pencil eraser) will be 
taken from an area of lower hip/buttock skin. If needed, a suture will be placed.

4 pm: The same procedure will be repeated from a region of lower hip/buttock skin on the 
opposite side of the body (left/right). If needed, a suture will be placed

Your participation in this study may be completed in one day and will involve the collection of skin 
punch biopsies at two time periods (around 8 am and 4 pm). If you need sutures, then you will be 
asked to return to the research office in 10-14 days for suture removal.
Potential risks:

Skin Biopsies: Risk of allergic reaction to the local anesthetic lidocaine, risk of small scar at the 
biopsy sites, risk of wound infection at the biopsy sites, risk of bleeding from the biopsy site.
Additional information regarding all potential risks is listed on page 5.
You may not benefit by participating in this study.  However, the information gained may be helpful to 
others.
The alternative to participating in this study is to not participate as it is not a treatment study.
Introduction and Background Information
The purpose of this consent form is to give you information about this research study.  It will describe 
the purpose, procedures, benefits, risks, and discomforts of this study.  The principal investigator (PI) 
and/or the study staff will discuss this study with you and explain everything in detail.  Please ask 
them to explain any words or information that you do not clearly understand.
This study does not involve any particular diagnosis.  The goal of this research study is to explore the 
effects of artificial sunlight (ultraviolet B radiation; UVB) on the skin of day and night shift workers.  
Sunlight exerts many effects on the body.  We have evidence that skin responds differently to 
ultraviolet B radiation (UVB, which are the burning rays of sunlight) at different times of the day and 
that people who work night shifts may be less able to properly respond to UVB radiation than people 
who work a normal day shift.  In fact, we feel that this difference in how the skin reacts to UVB may 
be why night shift workers are at a greater risk of developing skin cancer.
The study is being conducted at the Wright State Physicians Pharmacology Translational Unit under 
the direction of Dr. Jeffrey Travers, Principal Investigator. The study is being carried out with funds 
received from the National Institutes of Health.  The total number of subjects will be up to 48 
individuals (12 male and 12 female individuals that have worked primarily either day or night shifts in 
the past 3 months). 
Purpose
This study is designed to test whether UVB (burning rays of sunlight) treatment of the skin will result 
in different responses in the morning and afternoon in people who work a day or night shift schedule. 
Why am I being asked to participate in this research study?
You are being asked to take part in this study because you meet the criteria for this study.

Procedures
If you agree to be in this study, you will be one of up to 48 subjects who will be participating in this 
research locally.
You will be requested to do the following things: 
Screening Period -31 to 0 Days (for females only)
If you are a female, you will have a screening period to ensure you are enrolled between days 20 and 
30 of your menstrual cycle.
At both 8 am and 4 pm (+/- 1 hr.):
After informed consent, you will be asked to fill in a monthly calendar outlining your approximate work 
schedule for the past three calendar months to allow evaluation of wake/sleep cycle. This consists of 
placing the approximate work shift (eg, 11PM-7AM) for each day worked in the past three months.  
Next, the areas to be biopsies will be marked and photographed (with any recognizable areas/buttocks 
shielded). The skin biopsies will be taken from a region of lower hip/buttock skin. For the four skin 
biopsies, the skin will be prepared in the usual sterile manner and anesthetized with 1% lidocaine with 
1:100000 epinephrine.  The lidocaine is a numbing medication and the epinephrine is used to decrease 
bleeding from the skin.  The punch biopsy consists of cutting a round hole 5 mm (1/5 inch; the size of

a pencil eraser) across the top layer of skin.  If needed, a suture will be placed.  Wound care will be 
discussed and a sample of petrolatum ointment and band aids supplied.  The biopsies will be taken to 
our laboratory, exposed to UVB radiation, and tested for various proteins and genes that we think are 
important in UVB responses.  This process will be carried out at both 8 am and 4 pm on the same day 
using lower hip/buttock skin from opposite sides of the body. The 8 am visit will take less than 2 hours 
and the 4 pm visit should take less than one hour each time.
Suture Removal.  If sutures were placed for the skin biopsies, then you would be scheduled to have 
them removed 10-14 days after their placement.
What Steps Are Being Taken to Reduce Risk of Coronavirus Infection?
The following steps are being taken to address the risk of coronavirus infection: 
Screening: If you show potential symptoms of COVID-19 (fever, cough, shortness of breath, etc.) 
then you will NOT be permitted to participate in this study at this time. 
Physical distancing: Whenever possible, we will maintain at least 6 feet of distance from you while 
conducting the study. 
Mask/Covering: We will wear a mask and you will be required to shield your mouth and nose with a 
cloth face cover or mask during the study, even when maintaining at least 6 feet of distance. If you do 
not have a mask, one will be provided when entering the building. Tissues will be available to cover 
coughs and sneezes.
Handwashing: We will wash hands before/during examination or use a hand sanitizer. We will ask 
you to do the same.
Disinfecting materials: When feasible, we will clean and disinfect surfaces before your visit, using 
an EPA-registered disinfectant for hard materials and by laundering soft materials. Disinfected 
materials will be handled using gloves, paper towel, plastic wrap or storage bags to reduce the 
chance of re-contamination of materials.
Electronics: Alcohol-based wipes or sprays will be used to disinfect shared touch screens, mice, 
keyboards, etc. Surfaces will be dried to avoid pooling of liquids.
Potential Risks
1. Skin biopsies: risk of allergic reaction to the local anesthetic lidocaine, risk of small scar at the 
biopsy sites, risk of wound infection at the biopsy sites, risk of bleeding from the biopsy site. 
2. There is also the potential risk of loss of confidentiality, but this will be minimized as samples will 
be labeled with numeric numbers --001, 002, 003 etc.
3. In addition, you may suffer harms that we have not seen before.

Research Subject Costs 
There will be no costs to you for any of the procedures or testing done as part of this research study 
Compensation & Treatment for Injury
You will be paid for participating in this study.  You will be paid for each completed visit as follows:

$20 for Informed Consent 

$20 for completing a 3 month calendar of work shifts

$25 for each of the two skin biopsies at 8 am

$25 for each of the two skin biopsies at 4 am
If you complete all study visits, you will receive a maximum payment of $140.00.  If you don’t 
complete the study, you will be paid for the procedures you do complete.    
If you are injured by being in this research study, Dr. Travers will arrange for you to get medical 
treatment.  The most likely adverse reaction would be a biopsy site infection, which would manifest as 
increased pain and pus in the biopsy site approximately 4-7 days after the procedure.  If that happens, 
Dr. Travers will provide you with a tube of the prescription antibiotic mupirocin ointment.  If that is not 
effective, then, Dr. Travers will prescribe an oral antibiotic.  You or your insurance company would be 
responsible for paying for the cost of the prescription oral antibiotic, but there will be no cost for Dr. 
Travers’ services.   If you are injured, there is no money set aside for lost wages, discomfort, disability, 
etc. You do not give up your legal rights by signing this form.  If you think you have a research related 
injury, please call the research office at (937) 245-7500 or Dr. Travers at (937) 775-2463. Should an

Use of Genetic Samples
A Federal law, called the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (GINA), generally makes it illegal 
for health insurance companies, group health plans, and most employers to discriminate against you 
based on your genetic information. This law generally will protect you in the following ways: 

Health insurance companies and group health plans may not request your genetic information that 
we get from this research.

Health insurance companies and group health plans may not use your genetic information when 
making decisions regarding your eligibility or premiums. 

Employers with 15 or more employees may not use your genetic information that we get from this 
research when making a decision to hire, promote, or fire you or when setting the terms of your 
employment.
You should also know that this new Federal law does not protect you against genetic discrimination 
by companies that sell life insurance, disability insurance, or long-term care insurance.
Data Security 
All conversations and procedures will take place in the Wright State Physician’s building in the 
dermatology clinic in a private examining room.  The data will be kept in the locked office of the PI.
