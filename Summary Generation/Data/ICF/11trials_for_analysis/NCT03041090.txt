Title of Project: 
Patterns and Prevalence of FDG extravasation in PET/CT scans 
 
 
 
 
“You” refers to the person who takes part in the research study. 
 
You are being asked to take part in a research study conducted by Dr. Medhat Osman 
because you are scheduled for a standard of care PET/CT exam at SSM Saint Louis 
University Hospital. 
 
This consent document may contain words that you do not understand.  Please ask the 
research study doctor or research staff to explain anything that you do not understand. 
  
 
1. WHY IS THIS RESEARCH STUDY BEING DONE? 
 
PET/CT scans play a vital role in imaging for the brain, heart, and in many types of 
cancer.  When physicians read the images, they often obtain a value, called a Standard 
Uptake Value (SUV) from the images.  It has been determined that SUV values can be 
influenced by the patient’s height and weight and also by the amount of radioactive 
tracer given to a patient. 
 
For a PET/CT scan, the radioactive tracer is injected into a vein (usually in the hand, 
elbow, or lower arm).  If the tracer does not all go into the vein and some leaks out into 
the surrounding tissues, the tracer will possibly not distribute correctly in the body.  It is 
suspected that leaking tracer could affect the SUV values and thus alter a physician’s 
ability to read the scan accurately. 
 
This study hopes to look at the prevalence and pattern of tracer leaking around the 
injection site through the use of a non-invasive device made by Lucerno Dynamics, the 
study sponsor. This device has four passive sensors with the ability to detect radioactive 
counts from the PET tracers that will be placed on separate sites of the body to 
measure if the radioactive PET/CT tracer is distributing as planned. 
 
Saint Louis University aims to enroll 250 subjects into this study.

2. WHAT AM I BEING ASKED TO DO?  
 
If you choose to participate in this study, it should only add less than 5 minutes to the total 
time you are here for your PET/CT exam.  Once the technologist has asked all the 
questions to confirm your PET/CT exam, the study procedures will begin.  The Lucerno 
device sensors will be placed on the skin in four separate locations: over the injection site, 
the same site on the opposite arm, over the subclavian area, and over the liver (right side 
of the abdomen below the rib cage).  These detectors have the ability to count the 
radioactive tracer as it circulates through your body and see if the tracer is distributing the 
way we think it should or if any remains at the injection site.  After the dye is injected, it 
normally needs to circulate for a minimum of 60 minutes before imaging.  The dectors will 
be placed at the time you are given the dye and remain in place for the whole circulation 
time.  If the camera bed (imaging couch that you lie upon to take PET/CT pictures) is 
available, you may be asked to spend the uptake period resting comfortably on the camera 
bed.  This would allow us to take pictures of the injection site to compare to the counts the 
sensors are getting.  If the camera bed is not available, the detectors will placed in the 
same way, they will just count the dye while you sit in a reclining chair and no comparison 
pictures will be obtained. 
 
After the 60 minute uptake period, the four sensors will be removed and you will proceed 
on with the normal PET/CT procedure your doctor ordered.  Once the standard of care 
PET/CT scan is complete, you will be asked to complete a short questionnaire about how 
comfortable it was to wear the detectors for the circulation period. Your standard of care 
PET/CT scan will be reviewed by a physician and a report will be sent to the doctor who 
ordered it, which is where you find out the results of the scan. 
 
3. HOW LONG WILL I BE IN THE RESEARCH STUDY? 
 
Your normal PET/CT scan process can take up to 2 hours. Your participation in this study 
will only be for the day of your PET/CT exam and will only add an additional 5 minutes or 
less to the total time of your scan.  If you come back for repeated PET/CT exams, you may 
be asked to repeat this research study and you can participate every time you are 
scheduled for a PET/CT exam.  The research team expects it will take approximately 3 
years to recruit the expected 250 patients, analyze the data, and publish our results. 
 
  
4. WHAT ARE THE RISKS?  
 
There are certain risks and discomforts that may occur if you take part in this research 
study.  One risk is discomfort from the detector’s adhesive pads when they are removed 
and discomfort while lying on the imaging table during the circulation period. If side effects 
or discomforts occur, Dr. Medhat Osman and his research team will try to help these by 
making you as comfortable as possible while the detectors are on and being sure to 
remove the adhesive pads to your comfort. There is also a risk of allergic type skin 
reactions to the adhesives on the sensors. Study team members will monitor you while they 
are in place and remove them should you mention any signs of reaction such as redness, 
itchiness, burning, etc.. There is also a risk of loss of confidentiality with participation in this 
study. Our team works very hard to protect your private health information and only key 
Lucerno Dynamics Consent – Version 3

members will be able to access your identified data and any information shared outside the 
team will be coded, and thus not able to be traced back to you. The final risk is that of 
distress while filling out the questionnaire at the end of the study asking your comfort of 
wearing the detector devices. The study staff will be nearby and should you feel distressed, 
study team members will be available to answer questions or if necessary, discontinue 
research procedures.  
 
The research team is willing to discuss any questions you might have about these risks and 
discomforts. 
 
 
5. ARE THERE BENEFITS TO BEING IN THIS RESEARCH STUDY? 
 
You will not directly benefit from this research study. Your condition may get better, stay the 
same, or worsen. Even though you may not receive any immediate benefit, other people 
getting PET/CT scans may benefit in the future because of what the researchers learn from 
this research study. 
 
6. WHAT OTHER OPTIONS ARE THERE? 
 
You may choose not to be in this research study without affecting your PET/CT exam or 
your ordering doctor’s ability to get the results.  The only alternative to participating in the 
research study is to choose not to participate. 
  
7. WILL MY INFORMATION BE KEPT PRIVATE? 
 
The results of the research study may be published but your name or identity will not be 
revealed and your record will remain private.  In order to protect your information, Dr. 
Medhat Osman will never release any identifying information and will group the data with all 
the other participants so you cannot be identified. 
 
Your research record will contain identifiers such as your date of birth, date of exam, name, 
and gender.  Dr. Osman and his study team will keep your research record protected by 
keeping any paper documents behind two locked doors.  Any identifiable data that is 
electronic will be held on a secure server behind a firewall that is only accessible by study 
team members.   
 
Information collected for this research study will be shared with other researchers and our 
industry partner for this study, Lucerno Dynamics.  Lucerno Dynamics is the financial 
sponsor of our study and the group that provided the sensors for the study. Some of the 
information we capture will be shared with them, but it will be provided in a coded format 
(we keep any identified information at SLU and give them information only a study code – 
no name, date of birth, medical record number, etc. is shared). Lucerno Dynamics will only 
receive coded PET pictures the coded radiative counts from the detectors and coded 
questionnaire data.
