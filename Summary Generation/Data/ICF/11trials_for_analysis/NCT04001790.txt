study. Please ask the investigator or the study staff to explain any information in this 
consent document that is not clear to you. You may take home an unsigned copy of this 
consent form to think about or discuss with family or friends before making your decision.
Your participation is voluntary. You may decide not to participate in this study. If you do 
participate, you may withdraw from the study at any time. Your decision not to take part or to 
withdraw will involve no penalty or loss of benefits to which you are otherwise entitled.
AN OVERVIEW OF THE STUDY AND KEY INFORMATION
Why is this study being done?
The purpose of this research study is to find out some of the best ways to help people with 
autism spectrum disorder (ASD) get and keep a job. We think that a program called “Project 
SEARCH plus ASD Supports” (PS+ASD) may help people with ASD get a job because it 
teaches people with ASD about work and the kinds of jobs they might like to do. This study will 
allow us to learn more about it. 
You are being asked to take part in this study because you:
1. Have Autism Spectrum Disorder diagnosis
2. Attend a participating school 
3. Are between the ages of 18 and 21 at the time of enrollment. (You may turn 22 before 
the end of the study, but must be no older than 21 years at the time of enrollment.)

What will happen if I participate?
In this study, you will be asked to do the following things:
1. Meet with us and answer some questions at three different times during the research 
study. 
2. Go to either the PS+ASD program on base at Fort Eustis or go to your high school. 
3. Take surveys and answer questions about your support needs, abilities, quality of life, 
behaviors, and job history.
4. Give permission for the researchers to collect information about your education from 
your school records.
Here is a description of the two programs and how they are different from each other:
Program 1: PS+ASD Program
Program 2: School Group
What will I learn?
You will work in a community 
business at Fort Eustis to find out 
what you like.   
You will follow the schedule your 
school creates for you.  
Who will decide what 
I am taught?
We will talk to you about what you 
like and have you try new jobs on 
base at Fort Eustis. 
Your school will decide what is best 
for you to learn. 
How will I be taught? 
We will teach you skills by spending 
time with you and figuring out what 
help you need at a job.  
Your teachers will decide how to 
teach you information in your classes.  
How much time will it 
take?
This will take one school year.  
This might take 2 plus years 
depending on what you choose to do 
after the first year in the study. 
Will my parents be 
part of this? 
We will speak with your parents 
about how you are doing in the 
program.
The school will decide how and when 
to talk with your parents. 
What happens if I 
don’t learn these 
skills?
If you have trouble learning these 
skills, we will talk with you about 
better ways to help you learn. 
The school will decide how to help 
you.    
When will you meet 
with me to ask 
questions? 
We will meet with you, your parents, 
and your teachers 3;
1. At the very beginning of the 
school year in September or 
October. 
2. 12 months after beginning the 
school year in September or 
October. 
3. 18 months after beginning the 
school year in March or April.

You will be assigned by chance to either the PS+ASD program or the school group. You will not 
have a choice of which group you end up in. If you are assigned to the school group, you might 
be selected to be in the PS+ASD program in the next school year. Your participation in this 
study will last up to 32 months. A total of about 32 individuals with ASD will participate in this 
study. 
What alternative treatments or procedures are available?
The only alternative to this study is to not take part. In such cases, you will receive your 
education as usual. If you decide not to take part in the study, but are interested in work 
experiences like PS+ASD, we will talk to you about other similar programs if there are any by 
where you live.
What are the risks and benefits of participating?
Risks and Discomforts
Benefits to You and Others
1. Below are some of the most common risks 
and discomforts:

There are no risks beyond what you 
would encounter in a normal high 
school or work place. These are 
examples of issues that you may come 
across:  scheduling changes, and stress 
from peer and/or boss interaction.

Participation in research might involve 
some loss of privacy. There is a small 
risk that others may find out about 
your disability or other identifying 
information. 

The study questionnaires ask 
questions that are personal in nature 
and may make you feel 
uncomfortable. If so, you may skip 
that question, ask us to stop that line 
of questioning, or ask us to stop the 
interview at any time.
2. There may be some risks that the 
investigators do not know about yet, so we 
will let you know of any new findings. 
Taking part in this study will provide you 
with the opportunity to engage in community-
based work experiences that might lead to job 
while transitioning from high school to 
adulthood.  It may help you get a job more to 
your liking than if you were not part of the 
study.  It is also possible that you will not get 
or keep a job.  
Even though you may not get a job from this 
study, the information we learn from people 
in this study may help us design better ways 
to help people with disabilities get jobs in the 
future.

DESCRIPTION OF THE STUDY AND YOUR INVOLVEMENT
If you decide to take part in this study, you will be asked to participate in an assessment before 
being assigned to one of the two training programs at either your high school or the PS+ASD 
program at Fort Eustis. During this assessment, we will ask some personal information like for 
your name, address, and date of birth, and then ask you to complete some questionnaires. 
The questionnaires are; the Support Intensity Scale, The Social Responsiveness Scale, the 
Behavior Assessment Scale for Children Adolescent Version and the Quality of Life 
Questionnaire. The assessments will be done by trained staff at the beginning of the study, 12 
months after entering the study, and 18 months after entering the study.  Assessment information 
may be collected from students, parents or guardians, and teachers. We will use the information 
to determine your skills, abilities, and support needs so that we can best match you to internships 
and determine the level of support you will need during the course of the study.  The assessment 
will occur at a private place and time fitting to you and will take approximately 1.5 hours to 
complete.  There may be questions that cause you discomfort or distress during the assessment. 
If you feel discomfort or distress, you may skip those questions, ask to stop that line of 
questioning or ask to stop the interview.  
Once in the study, you will receive educational services in one of two programs. The first 
program is in your high school.  The second is a 9-month internship job training program at Fort 
Eustis Military Base.  Project staff will assign you to one of the two programs.  Neither you nor 
your parents will have a choice of the program to which you are assigned.  Project staff will 
make program assignments by chance.  If you are in the study, you will have an equal chance of 
being in either program as anyone else in the study.  If you are assigned to the high school group, 
you may be able to enroll in the 9 month internship in a community business after you spend one 
school year in the high school group.
Both programs will begin on the first day of school in the fall and last until the last day of school 
in the spring.  Both programs will follow the public schools calendar.  You will be required to 
attend the program when school is in session, and will be off when school is not in session.  If 
you are assigned to the PS+ASD program, you will attend school at a Fort Eustis.  You are 
responsible for finding and arranging your way to and from the community business.  If you 
would like, we will help you learn how to use public transportation before the internship program 
begins.  If you are assigned to the high school program, you will use a school bus or car to get to 
and from your school.  If you are assigned to the high school program, your school day will 
follow the school’s schedule.  Your school day in the community business will start and end at 
the same time as your high school.  Once you complete either program, you may choose to 
graduate from high school if you so desire, provided that you are still of an age to be in high 
school. If you are too old to continue in high school, you will have to graduate. If you are unsure 
if you must graduate at the end of this study, please contact your teacher for more information. 
As a part of this research study, we will stay in touch with you for a period of 18 months after 
you enroll in the study.  You will take part in assessments and be asked to complete a survey 
about your job and job training. The assessments and surveys will be collected three different 
times when you enroll in the study, 12 months after you enroll in the study and 18 months after 
you enroll in the study.

We will share with you important findings that we learn during this study.  These findings may 
affect your decision whether or not you want to continue to taking part in this study.
WHAT ARE THE COSTS?
The cost for taking part in the high school job training program includes any high school fees 
you would normally pay to the school.  The cost for taking part in the community based job 
training program include: 
1. Getting to and from the business daily 
2. Buying appropriate clothing (which may include buying uniforms)
3. Buying lunch if you are not able to bring a lunch from home  
Also, part of the cost will be the time you spend in the study itself.  The University will not 
charge you anything for taking part in this study.
WILL I BE PAID TO PARTICIPATE IN THE STUDY?
We will provide you with compensation for your time to complete the interviews and surveys as 
described below:
Completion of the first surveys at the beginning of the study - $75.00
Completion of the second surveys 12 months after beginning the study - $75.00
Completion of the third and final surveys 18 months after beginning the study - $75.00
Bonus for completing all of the surveys at all three times - $75.00
Total possible compensation across 18 months - $300.00
We will offer this compensation to you in the form of a gift card. Please be aware that the 
investigative team and the University may receive money to conduct this study.
CAN I STOP BEING IN THE STUDY?
You can stop being in this research study at any time. Leaving the study will not affect your 
education or employment status. Tell the study staff if you are thinking about stopping or decide 
to stop.
If you decide to withdraw from the study, you will return to the high school program which you 
would normally attend as long as you are eligible to continue attending that school.  If you stop 
participating in the study and no longer attend program activities you will be considered to have 
withdrawn from the study. If you withdraw for any reason, after receiving any part of the study 
activities, you will be asked to be available for follow-up assessment. Specifically, you will be 
asked to complete all assessments scheduled and to provide all follow-up information.
Your participation in this study may be stopped at any time by the investigator without your 
consent. The reasons might include:
●
the investigator thinks it necessary for your health or safety
●
you are found to not be eligible for the study 
●
the sponsor has stopped the study 
●
you have not followed study instructions
●
administrative reasons require your withdrawal

HOW WILL INFORMATION ABOUT ME BE PROTECTED?
In this study, we will gather information about your job history.  Your information will be added 
with the information from the other people in the study.  We will compare the job training 
programs with each other.  We will protect your information by saving it on a password 
protected encrypted computer. 
We will not tell anyone the answers you give us, however, information from the study and the 
consent form signed by you may be looked at or copies for research or legal purposes by the 
sponsor of the research or by Virginia Commonwealth University. Personal information about 
you might be shared with or copied by officials at the Department of Health and Human 
Services, Department of Defense or other federal regulatory bodies.  The name of the group 
paying for this research is the Congressionally Directed Medical Research Projects (CDMRP).  
In the future, identifiers might be removed from the information you provide in this study, and 
after that removal, the information could be used for other research studies by this study team or 
another researcher without asking you for additional consent. With your permission we might 
send reports and other information to other agencies that serve you.  We will only do this if you 
have given us permission by signing the “Parent/Student Permission to Release Information” 
located in Part B of the application on page 6. If you tell us that you may hurt yourself or 
someone else, the law says that we must let people in authority know.
We will not give you any individual results from the study. A description of this clinical trial will 
be available on http://www.ClinicalTrials.gov, as required by U.S. Law. This Web site will not 
include information that can identify you. At most, the Website will include a summary of the 
results. You can search this Web site at any time. 
Certificate of Confidentiality
To help us protect your privacy, we have received a Certificate of Confidentiality from the 
National Institutes of Health. With this Certificate, the researchers cannot be forced to disclose 
information that may identify you, even by a court subpoena, in any federal, state, or local civil, 
criminal, administrative, legislative, or other proceedings. The researchers will use the 
Certificate to resist any demands for information that would identify you, except as explained 
below.
The Certificate cannot be used to resist a demand for information from personnel of the United 
States Government that is used for auditing or evaluation of federally funded projects or for 
information that must be disclosed in order to meet the requirements of the federal Food and 
Drug Administration (FDA).
You should understand that a Certificate of Confidentiality does not prevent you or a member of 
your family from voluntarily releasing information about yourself or your involvement in this 
research. If an insurer, employer, or other person obtains your written consent to receive research 
information, then the researchers may not use the Certificate to withhold that information.
The Certificate of Confidentiality does not prevent the researchers from disclosing voluntarily, 
without your consent, information that would identify you as a participant in the research project 
under the following circumstances: If you or your students tells us you intend to hurt yourself or 
others, or if we learn about real or suspected abuse.
