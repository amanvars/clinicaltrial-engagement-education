The sponsor of this study is the Rehabilitation Research and Development Service of 
the Veterans Administration.
5.  In general, what do you need to know about this Research Study?
Agreeing to become involved in any research is always voluntary.  By signing this form, 
you are not waiving any of your legal rights.  If you decide not to participate in this 
research, you will not be penalized in any way and you will not lose any benefits to 
which you are entitled. If you have questions about your rights as a research subject, 
please call the University of Florida Institutional Review Board (IRB) office at (352) 273-
9600 or the North Florida/South Georgia Veteran’s Health System Research Service 
Office at (352) 548-6069.     
a) In general, what is the purpose of the research, how long will you be 
involved?  The purpose of this research study is to determine whether Goal 
Management Training (GMT) plus attention training is more effective than a control 
treatment on planning and organization skills for veterans diagnosed with mild 
traumatic brain injury. We anticipate your participation in this study to be a total of 
9 months.
b) What is involved with your participation, and what are the procedures to be 
followed in the research? The research study will include a total of 1-23 
sessions. The first session is a screening session where you will answer 
questionnaires and complete tests of your thinking skills both in-person and over 
the internet . Some of the tests will determine whether or not you meet the 
criteria to be included in the study.  Typically, testing takes 3-4 hours. After the 
screening you will be told whether or not you meet the inclusion criteria to 
participate in the rest of the study.  If you do not meet the criteria to continue with 
the study, you will again confirm that you are OK with the retention of the data 
collected (results of tests of thinking skills, attention, effort, word reading, 
planning and problem solving, depression, post-traumatic stress disorder, 
combat exposure, pain, alcohol use, concussions, symptoms, anxiety, sleep, 
fatigue, community participation, age, employment status, time from deployment 
and service).  If the test results meet the inclusion criteria you will be scheduled 
for a test of grocery shopping skills at a local grocery store that will take 
approximately 1 hour.  You will be assigned to either GMT plus attention training

or Brain Health Workshop plus movies. Training consists of 20 weekly 2-hour 
sessions. Sessions will include an interactive group or individual training 
conducted using telehealth through the Veterans’ Health Administration. You will 
also be asked to do homework up to five hours a week if you are randomized to 
the GMT/attention training. Two follow-up testing sessions are approximately 3 
hours long and occur once training is completed and repeated six-months after. 
Additionally, a friend or family member you identify will answer a questionnaire 
about your thinking skills at each of the three testing sessions.
This study also has an option to engage in an Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) 
before and after GMT or BHW if you are not a women with childbearing potential. 
An MRI is a procedure that allows doctors to look inside the body by using a 
scanner that sends out a strong magnetic field and radio waves. The scan will 
last no more than 90 minutes that includes a 15 minute task where you will select 
what direction an arrow is pointing and a 15 minute task where you will do 
nothing. This procedure is used routinely for medical care and is very safe for 
most people, but you will be monitored during the entire MRI scan in case any 
problems occur. Initial the boxes if you are interested in participating in an MRI 
for this study. 
 
c) What are the likely risks or discomforts to you? The following facts are 
important in considering your participation in this research:
You may experience some anxiety when answering questions about depression 
and post-traumatic stress. Additionally, you may become frustrated and/or tired 
during testing of your thinking skills. Researchers will take appropriate steps to 
protect any information they collect about you. However there is a slight risk that 
information about you could be revealed inappropriately or accidentally.
If you choose the option of participating in the MRI scan, refer to the following 
potential risks: 1) The MRI scanner contains a very strong magnet. Therefore, you 
may not be able to have the MRI if you have any type of metal implanted in your 
body, for example, any pacing device (such as a heart pacer), any metal in your 
eyes, or certain types of heart valves or brain aneurysm clips. 2)There is not much 
room inside the MRI scanner. You may be uncomfortable if you do not like to be in 
closed spaces ("claustrophobia").  3)The MRI scanner produces a loud hammering 
noise, which has produced hearing loss in a very small number of patients. 4) If 
you are a woman of childbearing potential, there may be unknown risks to the 
fetus so you will not be able to participate in the MRI.

d) What are the likely benefits to you or to others from the research? You may 
or may not benefit from participating in this research study. The possible benefits 
are that you will have a thorough assessment of your thinking skills. Your 
participation may improve future treatment of the thinking skills of individuals who 
have been affected by a traumatic brain injury.
e) What are the appropriate alternative procedures or courses of treatment, if 
any, that might be helpful to you? As a Veteran, Individual Speech or 
Occupational Therapy is available to treat difficulties with your thinking skills.
Additional and more detailed information is provided within the remainder of this 
Informed Consent form, please read before deciding if you wish to participate in this 
study.
6.  What will be done as part of your normal clinical care (even if you did not 
participate in this research study)? 
Individual or group cognitive therapy for improving your thinking skills will be available 
to you, even if you do not wish to participate in this research study.
7.  What will be done only because you are in this research study?
The research study will include a total of 1-23 sessions. The first session is a 
screening session where you will answer questionnaires and complete tests of your 
thinking skills in-person and over the internet. Typically, testing takes 3-4 hours. If 
the test results meet the inclusion criteria you will be randomly assigned (much like 
being selected by the toss of a coin) to one of two groups: #1 Goal Management 
Training plus attention training or #2 Brain Health Workshop plus movies. 
Additionally, a friend or family member you identify will answer questionnaires about 
your thinking skills. You will also be asked to participate in a test demonstrating your 
grocery shopping skills in a neighborhood grocery store. 
#1Goal Management Training plus attention training consists of 20 session, 2-
sessions/week that are 2-hours long. Goal Management Training will include 
interactive power point presentations to learn strategies to plan and organize. 
Sessions will include lecture, paper and pencil tasks and discussions about 
strategies. You may participate individually or in a group setting using telehealth.

You will be asked to monitor your behavior at home and use a Smartphone AP to 
record practicing strategies to plan and organize in the community. Attention training 
will be conducted during 10-individual telehealth sessions on the computer and for 
five hours each week at home. 
If you were placed in group #2 “Brain Healthworkshop plus movies, you will not 
participate in GMT plus attention training. Group #2 consists of 20 session, 2-
sessions/week that are 2-hours long using telehealth.  Lectures and quizzes will be 
used to learn how the brain works. You will also select movies you are interested in, 
to view and answer 2-3 questions about the content. 
Once training is completed for either group, you will participate in another 3 hour 
testing of your thinking skills and you will be asked to participate in a test regarding 
grocery shopping skills in your neighborhood grocery store. Testing of your thinking 
skills will be repeated again 6 months after training is completed. 
During the study, you have the option to participate in an MRI scan, unless you are 
a women of childbearing age. If you want to pursue this option, you will undergo an 
MRI scan at the University of Florida MRI facility before and after GMT or BHW. The 
scan provides an analysis of brain structure, focusing on those areas important for 
attention and takes approximately 1 hour to complete. While in the scanner you will 
complete two tasks, one for 15 minutes called the attention network task where you 
will click a button when a middle arrow points left or right on a video screen. The 
second task you will do nothing for 15 minutes. This MRI procedure is optional; if 
you decide to participate in this procedure, initial this box .
Once this research study is completed, any information that could identify you might 
be removed from any identifiable private information and that, after such removal, the 
information could be used for future research studies or distributed to another 
investigator for future research studies without additional informed consent from you 
or your legally authorized representative.

WHAT ARE THE RISKS AND BENEFITS OF THIS STUDY AND 
WHAT ARE YOUR OPTIONS?
10. What are the possible discomforts and risks from taking part in this research 
study?
Researchers will take appropriate steps to protect any information they collect about 
you.  However there is a slight risk that information about you could be revealed 
inappropriately or accidentally.  Depending on the nature of the information such a 
release could upset or embarrass you, or possibly even affect your insurability or 
employability. 
Risks Associated with MRI: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a procedure that 
allows doctors to look inside the body by using a scanner that sends out a strong 
magnetic field and radio waves. This procedure is used routinely for medical care 
and is very safe for most people, but you will be monitored during the entire MRI 
scan in case any problems occur.
If you choose the option of participating in the MRI scan, refer to the following risks: 
1) The MRI scanner contains a very strong magnet. Therefore, you may not be able 
to have the MRI if you have any type of metal implanted in your body, for example, 
any pacing device (such as a heart pacer), any metal in your eyes, or certain types 
of heart valves or brain aneurysm clips. Someone will ask you questions about this 
before you have the MRI. 2) There is not much room inside the MRI scanner. You 
may be uncomfortable if you do not like to be in closed spaces ("claustrophobia"). 
During the procedure, you will be able to talk with the MRI staff through a speaker 
system, and, in the event of an emergency, you can tell them to stop the scan. 3) 
The MRI scanner produces a loud hammering noise, which has produced hearing 
loss in a very small number of patients. You will be given earplugs to reduce this 
risk. 4) If you are a woman of childbearing potential, there may be unknown risks to 
the fetus so you will not be able to participate in the MRI.
Question 17 in this form discusses what information about you will be collected, 
used, protected, and shared.

WHAT ARE THE FINANCIAL ISSUES IF YOU PARTICIPATE?
14. If you choose to take part in this research study, will it cost you anything?
There will be no costs to you for any procedure, treatment or testing done as part of 
this research study. However, medical care and services provided by the VA that 
are not being done only for this study (e.g., normal hospital and prescription 
expenses which are not part of the research study) will be charged to you or your 
insurance.  These costs may not be charged if you are a veteran and you are being 
treated at the North Florida/South Georgia Veterans Health System (NF/SG VHS), 
however some Veterans are required to pay co-payments for medical care and 
services provided by the VA. These co-payment requirements will continue to apply 
to VA-provided medical care and services that are not part of this study.
15. Will you be paid for taking part in this study?
You will receive reimbursement of $25.00 per completed session  for a potential of 
$575.00. If you are randomized to the GMT and attention training you will also be paid  
$25 for each 5 hours of attention training homework, for a potential total 
reimbursement of $825.00. If you choose to participate in MRI scanning, you will be 
reimbursed $50 per completed scan for a potential total of an additional $100.
Your compensation for participation in this research study will come from the VA 
Finance Office, who will issue payment to you by direct deposit to your bank account. 
The US Treasury requires that all participants in this study receive their study related 
compensation as an electronic transfer of money directly to your bank account. You 
will need to complete a “Vendor Form for EFT Payments (Direct Deposit)”, and turn it 
into the VA Finance Office. This form will ask for your name, social security number, 
and banking information so that the study payment can be processed. Alternatively, 
you can mail the form directly to Finance Office.
You are responsible for paying income taxes on any payments provided by the study. 
Any payment made to you on a  VA-funded study, regardless of amount, has to be 
reported to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) because the payment system cannot 
distinguish payment from reimbursement for expenses.

16. What if you are injured because of the study?  
If you experience an injury or illness as a result of your participation in this VA 
approved research study, all medical treatment considered necessary by your 
physician (emergency as well as medical treatment beyond emergency) will be 
provided by the VA. There will be no cost to you, unless you fail to follow the 
directions of the study procedures. Care will be provided at a VA medical facility 
unless the VA medical facility is not capable of providing the care. If this occurs, you 
will be treated by a private facility or physician and the VA will pay the private facility 
or physician for the reasonable cost of your care. In some cases the VA may 
approve private care for a non-veteran.
If you do not follow study procedures, you may be treated by the VA on the basis of 
your veteran's eligibility. If you are not a veteran and have not followed study 
procedures the VA can only provide limited care at your expense.
No additional money has been set aside for pain, suffering or any money losses you 
may suffer during your treatment. You have not waived any legal rights by signing 
this form.
In the event of a research-related injury, have questions about any discomforts that 
you experience while participating in this study  or if you experience an adverse 
reaction, please immediately contact the Principal Investigator listed in question 3 of 
this form during the day and (352) 871-0282 after business hours. If you seek 
emergency hospitalization in a private hospital because you are unable to come to 
the VA, have a family or friend contact your study doctor so that the VA can 
coordinate care with the private hospital.
17. How will your privacy and the confidentiality of your research records be 
protected?
Information collected about you will be stored in locked filing cabinets or in computers 
with security passwords. Study data will be collected in an application called the 
University of Florida REDCap on the University of Florida database. Only staff are 
given access to the application. Only certain people have the legal right to review 
these research records, and they will protect the secrecy (confidentiality) of these 
records as much as the law allows. These people include the researchers for this 
study, certain University of Florida officials, the hospital or clinic (if any) involved in this
