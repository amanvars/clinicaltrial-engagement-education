Title of Research Study: Diagnostic ultrasound for measuring fat of the body
Investigator: Murad Alam, MD
Supported By: This research is supported by Northwestern University.
Financial Interest Disclosure:  If your doctor is also the person responsible for this research 
study, please note that he is interested in both your clinical care and the conduct of this 
research study. You have the right to discuss this study with another person who is not part of 
the research team before deciding whether to participate in the research.
Key Information: 
The first few pages of this document include a summary of this study to help you 
decide whether or not to participate. Detailed information is provided after the 
summary.
Why am I being asked to take part in this research study?
We are asking you to take part in this research study because you have indicated that are in 
good health, have a Body Mass Index between 18-29.99 and expressed interest in participating 
in this research study. 
What should I know about a research study?

Someone will explain this research study to you.

Whether or not you take part is up to you.

You can choose not to take part.

You can agree to take part and later change your mind.

Your decision will not be held against you.

Why is this research being done?
The purpose of this research study is to provide information about human fat thickness just 
underneath the skin at different sites on the body by measuring it with a diagnostic ultrasound 
and also by linking participant perceptions of body image with the fat measurement.  The 
information may be useful in: looking at age, gender and racial differences in how fat is 
accumulated.  This may help with educating patients and better understanding which 
procedures may be better for particular patients.
How long will the research last and what will I need to do?
We expect that your participation in this research study will be for 1 day and that the study will 
last for up to 7 months.
You will be asked to:

How many people will be studied?
We expect about 40 people here at Northwestern University will be in this research study.
What happens if I say “Yes, I want to be in this research”?
As a participant in this study, you will be asked to come to the study site, Northwestern 
University Department of Dermatology, located at 676 North St. Clair Street, Suite 1600; 
Chicago, Illinois 60611.
Screening and Imaging visit 
If you agree to take part in the study, you will first be screened to determine if you are eligible to 
participate in the study. You will be asked to come to the study site for 1 Screening and Imaging 
Study Visit. This visit will take approximately 3 hours. The following procedures will be 
completed: 

You will be asked to read and sign this consent form.

You will be assigned a unique number to identify you in the research study.

A review will be done of your demographics (such as your gender, race and other 
background information), height and weight.

Photographs will be taken of  your neck region underneath your chin, upper inner arms, 
upper back, sides of stomach and lower back/hips, stomach (abdomen), inner and outer 
thighs.

High frequency ultrasound images will be taken from various regions of the body 
including, but not limited to your neck region underneath your chin, upper inner arms, 
upper back, sides of stomach and lower back/hips, stomach (abdomen), inner and outer 
thighs.
o
During the ultrasound, a probe (transducer) will be placed directly on your skin in 
the areas where the images will be taken.  The probe is connected to a 
computer.  The probe produces sound waves that bounce off body tissues and 
make echos.  The probe receives the echos and sends them to a computer 
which uses the echos to create an image called a sonogram.  
o
Before the probe is placed on your skin, a thin layer of gel will be applied to it.  
The gel will allow the sound waves to pass through from the probe, through the 
gel, into the body.  

You will be asked to fill out a brief questionnaire.  
What happens if I say “Yes”, but I change my mind later?
You can leave the research at any time; it will not be held against you.  If you decide to leave 
the research, please notify the study doctor. 
Choosing not to be in this study or to stop being in this study will not result in any penalty to you 
or loss of benefit to which you are entitled.  Specifically, your choice not to be in this study will 
not negatively affect your right to any present or future medical treatment,  your class standing 
(for students enrolled in a class at NU), or your present or future employment (for employees at 
NU or its affiliates).

Ultrasound

The probe can build up heat while the probe is not in use (in its holder) causing the 
probe to be warm to the skin.

The use of a damage probe can result in injury or increased risk of infection.  A 
damaged probe can also increase the risk of electric shock if solutions come in contact 
with internal device parts while on.

An ultrasound can produce harmful effects in tissue and potentially result in patient 
injury.  Exposure time will be minimized per body area and ultrasound levels will be kept 
low when there is no medical benefit.
Gel

The gel applied before the images are taken may feel cold.

There is a possibility that the gel may cause skin irritation or a skin allergic reaction
Please let the study staff know if you have any problems during the procedures.
This study involves the use of your identifiable, personal information and there is a chance that
